  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Cool Quote is a facilitator.</strong> We do not supply or install products. We connect you with independent, qualified local fitters who carry out the installation. Any installation contract is between you and the fitter.</p>
  <h3>Quotes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Quotes are indicative and based on information you provide.</li>
    <li>Quotes are valid for 30 days unless stated otherwise.</li>
    <li>Further site information or photos may be requested by the fitter.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Payments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The consignment fee/deposit (£150 + VAT) is payable to Cool Quote at acceptance.</li>
    <li>Remaining balance is paid through the platform to the fitter after job completion.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Liability</h3>
  <p>Cool Quote is not responsible for the works carried out by the fitter. Responsibility for workmanship, warranties and compliance sits with the fitter.</p>
